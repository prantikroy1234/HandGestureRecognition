# HandGestureRecognition
A Crude model of hand gesture recognition using Mediapipe
# ✋ Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe & OpenCV

This project uses **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** in Python to detect and recognize hand gestures from a live webcam feed in real-time. It classifies common gestures like `Fist`, `Thumbs Up`, `Peace`, and more based on hand landmark positions.



🧠 Features

- Real-time hand tracking using **MediaPipe**
- Landmark-based finger detection logic
- Gesture classification for:
  - 👍 Thumbs Up  
  - ✋ Open Palm  
  - ✊ Fist  
  - ✌️ Peace  
  - ☝️ Pointing  
  - 🤙 Pinky  
  - 🖖 Four Fingers  
- Easily extensible for more gestures or ML-based classification
