# HandGestureRecognition
A Crude model of hand gesture recognition using Mediapipe

This project uses **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** in Python to detect and recognize hand gestures from a live webcam feed in real-time. It classifies common gestures like `Fist`, `Thumbs Up`, `Peace`, and more based on hand landmark positions.



Features

- Real-time hand tracking using **MediaPipe**
- Landmark-based finger detection logic
- Gesture classification for:
  -  Thumbs Up  
  -  Open Palm  
  -  Fist  
  -  Peace  
  -  Pointing  
  -  Pinky  
  -  Four Fingers  
- Easily extensible for more gestures or ML-based classification
